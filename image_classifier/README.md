### Work was done on the workspaces provided by Udacity and files were copied here for convenience.

#### Part 1 Files
1. image-classifier-part1-notebook.html

A copy of the completed Part 1 Notebook.

#### Part 2 Files
1. model.py
2. utils.py
3. predict.py
4. train.py
5. workspace_utils.py (provided, but included here)
6. cat_to_name.json (provided, but included here)

Only train.py and predict.py should be called directly. Use the `--help` flag with either to get usage statements.

#### Other
1. predict-test-cases.txt
2. train-test-cases.txt

These files contain the commands that I ran to ensure that train.py and predict.py work as expected.

#### Notes
1. Datasets are not included, per the submission instructions.
2. Some input validation is done, but I intentionally didn't spend a ton of time here. Should I receive feedback on this project that requires significant rework, I'd rather focus on that before burning time sweating the small stuff.
